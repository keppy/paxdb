# paxdb

Graph Data System (GDS) with a leveldb persistence layer. As name implies this is an overly ambitious project; there is no paxos implementation and there is no live data aggregation. Yet.
Written in Clojure.

## Todo

- indicies - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/IndexedDB/Using_IndexedDB#Using_an_index
- transactions - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/IndexedDB/Using_IndexedDB#Adding_and_removing_data
- messaging layer

Need to parse my new notes on graph database design and come up with a set of cleanup tasks for the current code base. I will upload a 'roadmap' document once I have something more concrete--notes are currently scattered.
